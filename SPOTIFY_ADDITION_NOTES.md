Spotify Tools Addition Script

The git reset removed ALL previous improvements to studyBuddyService.ts.

## What was lost:
1. useCalendarStore import
2. useSpotifyStore import (not added yet)
3. 6 new tools: editTask, deleteTask, getTasks, createCalendarEvent, sendMessage, scheduleBreak
4. Enhanced system prompt
5. Implementation logic for all 6 tools

## What needs to be added now:
1. All 6 previous tools (from earlier session)
2. 5 new Spotify tools
3. Implementation logic for all 11 tools total

I'll manually reconstruct the complete file...
